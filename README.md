# Harris-County-Hospital-Project
Python and SQL

## PURPOSE
The purpose of this project was to build a Dashboard to view the information gathered from the individual datasets for each Harris County Hospitals. Another reason was to make a dashboard to view the possible growth of Harris County Hospital's within the given years from the datasets.

## DATA SELECTION
Harris Hospital Data was collected from the Texas Department of State Health Services website. From their website I was able to get the following data, Facility and Bed Counts, Charity Care, Surgical Operations, and Admissions, Inpatient Days and Length of Stay. Each data set was contained a range of years with each one varying between 2-5 years, from 2017 to 2022.
